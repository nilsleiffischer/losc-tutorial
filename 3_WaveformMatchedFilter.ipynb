    "\n",
    "We will be using the [PyCBC](http://github.com/ligo-cbc/pycbc) library, which is used to study gravitational-wave data, find astrophysical sources due to compact binary mergers, and study their parameters. These are some of the same tools that the LIGO and Virgo collaborations use to find gravitational waves in LIGO/Virgo data \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will walk through how find a specific signal in LIGO data. We present how to generate the waveform of a gravitational-wave merger and matched filtering, which is optimal in the case of Gaussian noise and a known signal model. In reality our noise is not entirely Guassian, and in practice we use a variety of techniques to separate signals from noise in addition to the use of the matched filter. \n",

    "Here we'll generate the gravitational waveform using one of the available waveform approximants. These can be generated as a time series using [`get_td_waveform`](http://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/pycbc.waveform.html#pycbc.waveform.waveform.get_td_waveform). There are some additional examples using this interface [here](http://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/waveform.html). The key parameters are the masses of the binary (given in solar masses), the time between samples (in seconds), the starting gravitational-wave frequency (Hz) and the name of the approximant we'd like to generate. A variety of approximants are available that include different physical effects. A full review of the different models is outside of the scope of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we've chosen to use the 'SEOBNRv4_opt' model. There are many others available as well with different methodologies and which include different physical effects. This is an implementation of the model introduced [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03703.pdf). It models the gravitational waveform of inspiralling and merging black holes, and includes the ability for each black hole to spin in the same direction as the orbit (aligned spin)."
